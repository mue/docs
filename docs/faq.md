Frequently asked questions about the Mue project.

Q: Can I use the branding assets?

A: Sure! Checkout the page [here](https://muetab.com/branding) for downloads. Please do not modify them.

Q: Do you track me?

A: We don't track you. The entire Mue source code for Mue and all components is available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/mue). If you're not convinced, you can turn on "Offline Mode" in the Mue 
settings and the extension will no longer make requests to our domains (and external ones).

Q: How do I uninstall Mue?

A: Simply right click the Mue icon on your browser and click uninstall. You can also visit the store page where you got Mue from and click the remove button.
